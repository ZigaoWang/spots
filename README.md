# **SPOTS**  
### *Smart Parking Organization & Tracking System*  


## Overview  
In busy cities like Shanghai, finding a parking spot can be one of the most frustrating parts of driving.  
Drivers often:  
- Spend several minutes circling parking lots.  
- Miss out on convenient spots near exits or elevators.  
- Wait in long payment queues just to leave.  

**SPOTS** solves all of this by **organizing** parking spaces intelligently and **tracking** them in real time — so drivers always know exactly where to go, and how to get out quickly.  

## How SPOTS Works  
1. When you drive into a parking lot, you choose what matters most to you:  
   - Near the elevator  
   - Close to a certain shop or zone  
   - Lowest cost  
   - Fast exit access  
2. SPOTS instantly assigns you the **best available space** according to your preference.  
3. The system **guides you directly** to that spot using on-site arrows, screens, or LED signs.  
4. Your assigned spot is secured with a **smart ground lock** — it only opens when you arrive.  
5. The spot’s display shows:  
   - Your license plate  
   - Parking start time  
   - QR code for payment  
6. When you’re ready to leave, simply scan the QR code for instant checkout and drive out — **no more waiting in line**.  

## Key Features  
- **Preference-Based Spot Assignment** – The parking space adapts to the driver, not the other way around.  
- **Direct Navigation** – Step-by-step guidance to minimize search time.  
- **Fair & Dynamic Pricing** – Pay less for far spots, more for premium locations.
